package Step6_LinkedList.SinglyLL;
/*
 * Given a LinkedList of integers. Modify the LinkedList in such 
 * \a way that in Modified LinkedList all the even numbers appear
 *  before all the odd numbers in LinkedList.

Also, note that the order of even and odd numbers should remain the
 same. 

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: 1→2→3→4→5→6→Null
Output: 2→4→6→1→3→5→Null
Explanation : 
Odd Nodes in LinkedList are 1,3,5 and 
Even Nodes in LinkedList are 2,4,6
In Modified LinkedList all even Nodes comes before 
all Odd Nodes. So Modified LinkedList looks like 
2→4→6→1→3→5→Null. Order of even and odd Nodes is 
maintained in modified LinkedList.

Example 2:
Input: 1→3→5→Null
Output: 1→3→5→Null
Explantion: As there are no Even Nodes in LinkedList, 
The Modified LinkedList is same as Original LinkedList.

Example 3:
Input: 2→4→6→8→Null
Output: 2→4→6→8→Null
Explanation: As there are no Odd Nodes in LinkedList, 
The Modified LinkedList is same as Original LinkedList.
