/*
 * Given the head of a linked list, return the node where 
 * the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node 
in the list that can be reached again by continuously 
following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to 
denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer 
is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no 
cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Do not modify the linked list.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where 
tail connects to the second node.
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where
 tail connects to the first node.
Example 3:


Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
