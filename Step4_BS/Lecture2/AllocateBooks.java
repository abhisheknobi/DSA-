/*
 * Problem Statement: Given an array ‘arr of integer numbers,
 *  ‘ar[i]’ represents the number of pages in the ‘i-th’ book. 
 * There are a ‘m’ number of students, and the task is to allocate
 *  all the books to the students.
Allocate books in such a way that:

Each student gets at least one book.
Each book should be allocated to only one student.
Book allocation should be in a contiguous manner.
You have to allocate the book to ‘m’ students such that the maximum 
number of pages assigned to a student is minimum. If the allocation 
of books is not possible. return -1

Examples

Example 1:
Input Format: n = 4, m = 2, arr[] = {12, 34, 67, 90}
Result: 113
Explanation: The allocation of books will be 12, 34, 67 | 90. One 
student will get the first 3 books and the other will get the last one.

Example 2:
Input Format: n = 5, m = 4, arr[] = {25, 46, 28, 49, 24}
Result: 71
Explanation: The allocation of books will be 25, 46 | 28 | 49 | 24.

We can allocate books in several ways but it is clearly said in the 
question that we have to allocate the books in such a way that the 
maximum number of pages received by a student should be minimum.


Assume the given array is {25 46 28 49 24} and number of students, M = 4.
 Now, we can allocate these books in different ways. Some of them are the following:


25 | 46 | 28 | 49, 24  → Maximum no. of pages a student receive = 73
25 | 46 | 28, 49 | 24  → Maximum no. of pages a student receive = 77
25 | 46, 28 | 49 | 24  → Maximum no. of pages a student receive = 74
25, 46 | 28 | 49 | 24  → Maximum no. of pages a student receive = 71

From the above allocations, we can clearly observe that the minimum possible maximum number of pages is 71.
